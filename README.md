# Brave Pose GUI

*GUI framework for those who feel brave*

## Why Haskell?

Haskell provides safety, performance, ease of testability and many advanced features other languages don't dispose.
Also a lot of beginners might want to try Haskell out and them being stuck to the terminal only is a sure way not to learn Haskell anymore.
